# ðŸ¦œðŸ”—ðŸ¤—  Search with LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, Chroma, FAISS, Azure OpenAI and OpenAI

Update 7/31 - Two new samples added for OpenAI
- Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE)
- - About: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06983.pdf
- - Sample: /SearchWithOpenAI/pages/150_FLARE_AOI.py
- Self-Ask prompting (building on Chain of Thought COT)
- - About: https://the-decoder.com/new-prompt-method-lets-gpt-3-answer-questions-better/
- - Sample: /SearchWithOpenAI/pages/160_Self_Ask_AOI.py


This project will help you learn the basics to -
- Index multiple documents in a repository using HuggingFace embeddings.
- Save the indexes in Chroma &  FAISS for recall.
- Cleanup / delete the indexes to start fresh.
- Query the FAISS and Chroma index / db.
- Search using embeddings (without having to sign up for any OpenAI) for similarity text snippets.
- Search with either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.  You will use the "Which API would you like to use?" page to choose the API to use.
- Bonus: Get details on cost of the call (AI tokens and cost) and also get similar information document search on the store.
